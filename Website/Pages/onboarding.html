                <p>The assignment was to create an interactive, animated, web based onboarding sequence that explains an important aspect about moving to Denmark to be a student on KEA multimedia design through gamification. The target group for the onboarding sequence is non-danes who are not living in Denmark and who are in the process of deciding whether they should apply to the multimedia design course in Copenhagen. As a group we came up with the idea on what concerns we should cover, but my main role in the project was more focused on the design and visual aspect of it rather than the coding. I created the backgrounds in Illustrator and made the sprite animation as well as making the moodboard and persona collage. </p>

                <p> For the development of our onboard sequence, there were multiple concerns to take into consideration. These include doubt regarding the facilities and resources within KEA, as well as opportunities to develop friendship and engage socially. These insights were gained through conducting both secondary desk research and face to face interviews, from native Danes and current international students to gain different perspectives. </p>

                <p>We were able to identify two different types of future students: those who are enthusiastic about the development of their study, with a concern towards KEA’s offerings and ultimately the facilities on the course, and those who consider their decision to relocate in order to study as an adventure, with a concern toward social integration. </p>

                <p>We developed our persona collage from these two types of students and came up with Jacob (see above) the adventurer and John the eager student (see left).</p>

            <div><img src="../Images/onboarding-storyboardtext.png" alt="heading" width=175>
                <p>Based on our research we chose to develop an onboarding sequence with a story themed around a mystery, which allows the user to explore KEA’s facilities and gain an understanding of the curriculum for the course. The main character is played by the user, who is a detective solving a mystery. As they enter a new scene, the characters goal is to answer questions, when answered correctly they get a new clue and proceed to the next level. The mascot provides hints which guides the user through.</p>

            <p>What I take from this project is better understanding and knowledge of CSS animations and drawing in Adobe Illustrator. I learned about onboarding, gamification and got a better understanding of storytelling.</p>
