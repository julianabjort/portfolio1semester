        <p>The focus of this assignment was to create a native app concept improving student life and studying for KEA students using the design sprint method. In this project we worked in a group of eight, where we had total freedom as UX designers to be creative and came up with a concise problem that needed to be solved. </p>

        <img src="../Images/ux-sprint-problem.png" alt="heading" width=300>

            <p> Moving to a new city is challenging for some and        establishing a new social network is an exciting yet daunting challenge for many. <br><br>

            Finding students that share common passions as you can be hard, organizing meet-ups with new people is an obstacle that can be scary to overcome. But if you are new to a school, country or city it is an essential part of your future student life.<br><br>

            Mainstream social media is so big and has so many users that it has begun to feel impersonal.
            To sum up our main problem is that studentâ€™s in KEA are lacking social activities especially outside of their class or moonbar.</p>

            <p>Rather than relying on other social media platforms to build a community in KEA, we would start our own social media platform specifically for students of KEA.

            A social web platform where students can create and join events. A one place for all to:

            Get introduced to the city through students in their second year making the transition easier, find other students with common interests as you and who are also new to the school, Copenhagen, or even Denmark as a whole. Create and post events specifically for KEA students, providing a new way to socialize with your classmates and others on campus. Have a more personal social media platform with a smaller membership group that creates a tighter network of people.

        <h3>visual design</h3>
        <p>We wanted a sans serif font for the app to be clear and easy to read, so we decided on Interstate regular. As our target audience is students we wanted the app to have a happy enthusiastic vibe, so we did some research on colour theory and found that orange would be appropriate as a theme.
