        <p>Build an XD prototype of a website which helps new international students in Copenhagen find a job. The focus is to work UX oriented to create an optimal user experience for the target audience. The provider of the site is the Danish government, the Ministry of Higher Education and Science. My main role was to make the XD prototype and write copy and microcopy, although we worked well as a team and everyone contributed to all aspects of the project. </p></div>

        <p>We started out by doing research on conventions in regards to design, content and functionality, and then create a digital solution that follows common conventions.
        We looked at other danish job portal sites and found out that they are all very similar, user-friendly and with sans-serif fonts resembling a flat design style. Colours are used to emphasize the navigation links and buttons and the user is clearly directed on how to apply for jobs. <br><br>
            We also did research on digital communication towards an international audience. We found that websites included features like help building a CV, videos from other expats talking about living in Denmark and finding a job, information about Denmark and danish culture in general, help learning danish, how the Danish labour market works and offer multiple language options. These are all features that we wanted to implement in our prototype.

        <p>
            We were aiming for a simple, easy to navigate and user friendly website for an international audience, so we chose to design the webpage in flat design because of it’s simplicity and boldness. We chose Futura and Helvetica because they are highly readable and  blue as the main theme colour as it’s associated with trust and that’s what we were aiming to establish with our users.
            <br><br>
            We decided that there should be a direct link to our website on ufm.dk to make it more visible and easier to find. In our final prototype there is a “Create a CV” function for users that don’t have a CV already with guidelines in each section. There are multiple language options for users who aren’t fluent in English to make the application process easier. We also included an information page feature, where the user can find information about moving to and living in Denmark as well as the job market and Danish culture.

        <p>With a rough idea in mind of what we were going to include in website we started out by making a low fidelity prototype and wireflow. This allowed us to explore different ideas without too much effort.</p>

        <div><img src="../Images/ux-hifi-text.png" alt="heading" width=175>
        <p>Then we proceeded on to making the high fidelity version, a clickable prototype in its closest resemblance to the final design in terms of details and functionality.</p>

        <div>
        <img src="../Images/ux-copy.png" alt="heading" width=100>
        <p>We used engaging copy and microcopy to make the website captivating, and to guide users through the webpage and make it easier to navigate, for example by putting keyword or job title/area in the search field and adding guidelines and answers to questions that users might have to make the process easier and give them ideas about what to write in each section.</p>

        <p>In this project I learned how to make low and high fidelity prototypes and a wireflow. This process makes it easier to explore different ideas without too much effort. I learned how to write copy and microcopy, and how good copy is what motivates, encourages, and convinces the target audience to engage. In conclusion I learned to work with research, analysis, content production and prototyping in the production of digital user interfaces.
