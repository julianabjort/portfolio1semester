        <p>In this assignment the task was to create a character and background, draw them in illustrator, make an animated sprite, and put everything together in css. First I chose a source of inspiration for my drawing style and collected visual elements from that, then I put it together in a moodboard and made a written analyses of the moodboard. I made sketches of my character with different expressions to make the sprite animation and a “turn around” of the character drawn in illustrator seen from front and side. </p>

    <p>I was inspired by the artists Sam Nassour and Borja Montoro who both have similar styles (see moodboard). I wanted my character to be likeable, friendly and charismatic, the kind of character I would have loved as a kid (my favourite character was Simba from the Lion King). I wanted my character to have an adventurous personality and be affectionate and kind towards others. I knew I wanted him to some kind of cute animal, and after careful consideration with some inspiration from Alvin and the chipmunks I came up with the idea of Chubbie, the friendly chipmunk. </p>

            <p>After filling out a worksheet and personality assessment of Chubbie, I came up with his story, The Tail of Chubbie..
            <br><br>
            Chubbie is a young Canadian chipmunk in high school. His dream is to become a singer, although he deals with a fear of public speaking and performance, so called stage fright. His story is about the school talent competition where he competes against Freddy the fox, who is also the school bully. Freddy tries all kinds of tricks to get Chubbie down, but Chubbie’s with the help of his friends manages to stay strong and overcome all of Freddy’s obstacles. The moral of the story is to always believe in yourself, go outside your comfort zone and overcome your fears.

        <p>The next step was to draw several different animation frames. I had a choice between animating a walk-cycle or animating a change of facial expression. I decided to make Chubbie sad, the face he would make when Freddy the fox would bully him. I drew six different frames showing the transition. I then animated them using keyframes in CSS. </p>

        <p>I started off by making a hand drawn sketch which I then made in Illustrator. The inspiration comes from a chipmunks natural habitat, the forest. </p>
