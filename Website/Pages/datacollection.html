    <p>This project was about getting know three different research methods. Desk research is a method which involves collecting data and information from existing resources such as the internet or books. Observation research is a technique which involves collecting data and information through observing. The researcher basically has to watch what people do in a specific setting and takes notes or record behaviour. Survey Research is a research technique which involves using surveys to collect data and information. Surveys are sent to respondents, data is then collected from the surveys and statistically analyzed to draw research conclusions.</p>

        <h3>observation research</h3>
        <p>I sat down in a fast food restaurant and watched the people in the queue. Most people were either looking down at their phone or at the menu to decide what they are going to order. There were all kinds of people but the majority is young people, my guess is around 18-30 years old. The environment is frantic and noisy, people coming and going all the time. Most people do not relate to each other in the queue, apart from people that obviously know each other.</p></div>

        <h3>desk research</h3>
        <p>I researched teenagers use of social media in connection with bullying. I found out that social media bullying is most common on Instagram (42%), followed by Facebook (37%) and Snapchat (31%) and women are at more risk than men of being bullied.

            Social media bullying statistics put LGBT teens at a 5 times higher risk of being abused on Facebook. Non-traditional sexual orientation is targeted more often online than in an offline environment. That is mostly because bullies feel they are more likely to get away with their actions online than in the real world. Facebook has over 83 million fake profiles, many of which protect the anonymity of bullies and trolls.</p></div>

    <div><h3>survey research</h3>
        <p>
        I investigated international students learning Danish. A total of 21 people took part in this survey. The results show that all of the participants want to learn Danish and many are willing to put full effort into learning the language but only a small fraction are willing to actually spend money on a Danish course. The most common reason for wanting to learn Danish is to get to know the culture and improve their chances of getting a job. Seeing as there are no free danish courses any more this shows that most people will try to learn Danish on their own, but put variable amount of effort into it.</p></div>

    <p>In this project I learned how to use desk research, surveys and interviews to produce data and insights about what users do and why by conducting the research mentioned above. I learned that it's important to use these methods so that I can make the right decisions in design and product development. I used these methods in later projects, for example the Prototype project 03.03.01 to research different job portal sites and their content. </p>
