        <p>The assignment was to create an educational campaign for Foodsharing Copenhagen to reduce food waste by improving consumersâ€™ capability to use what they already have before buying more. My main role in this project was to film and edit the video, as well as writing the narrator script. </p>

            We started by brainstorming some ideas, how could we make the most impact on our audience?
            <br><br>
            A team canvas was made to increase cohesion, clarify our goals and to help us to be more aligned and productive as a team. We agreed on the name Gaia for the group and The Leftovers for the campaign. Then began the ideation phase..
            </p></div>

        <div><img src="../Images/foodsharing-ideation.png" alt="heading" width=300>
        <p>We worked with various different ideation methods that are all built on the principle that the creative parts of the brain are induced and that our criteria filters are broken down. We wanted to think outside the box and try to come up with a creative solution. </p>

        <div><img src="../Images/foodsharing-storyboardtext.png" alt="heading" width=250>
                <p>After brainstorming we came up with a treatment and eventually a storyboard..
                <br><br>
                    The video can be divided into three sections, it starts by showing the viewer just how far the food travels to get to their plate, so they really get a feel for the effort and time it takes. To simplify the video we decided to demonstrate that with one example; the journey of the banana, but this journey resembles the journey for all imported foods. The second part of the video focuses on the problem, educating the viewer on food waste with some simple but shocking statistics and then some encouraging words and a reminder that the power to change this is in their hands. </p>

        <div><img src="../Images/foodsharing-storyboard1.png" alt="storyboard" width=450></div>

        <div><p>The third and final part focuses on the solution, six simple steps that can be taken to reduce food waste. These sections could also be cut into three separate videos, we had that in mind for social media.<br><br>

        We also made an extra video focusing on how to make use of old bananas. The video is short, to the point and demonstrates just how quick and easy it is to make banana bread.</p>

        <div><img src="../Images/foodsharing-thepitch.png" alt="heading" width=175>
        <p>In our pitch we focused on the idea that you as a consumer can make a big difference. You as a consumer have the power. We talked about the ripple effect and how our actions can effect others, how to make some changes to reduce food waste and then finally introduced our campaign website and video.

        <p>One of the most important lessons to be learned from this project is, again, teamwork and how to function in a group. I learned to work with Adobe Premiere Pro and how to edit videos. I learned the process of putting together a campaign, by putting together everything we learned over the semester from coding a webpage to making a video.
